The complete text can be found in 49 CFR Part 192.\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nPublic Law 104-304 requires the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to develop and enforce minimum safety regulations for the transportation of gases by  pipeline. The safety regulations became effective in 1970, and are published in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 190, 191, 192, and 199. The Office of Pipeline Safety of DOT’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is charged with their enforcement.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":310,"to":315}}}}],["27",{"pageContent":"The gas pipeline safety regulations apply to natural gas systems and operators of natural gas master meter systems. The pipeline safety regulations require operators of natural gas systems to: deliver gas safely and reliably to customers; provide training and written instruction for employees; establish written procedures to minimize the hazards resulting from natural gas pipeline emergencies; and, keep records of inspection and testing based on suggested forms found in Appendix B.\r\nAdditionally, operators of all natural gas systems,  except master meter systems, must test employees  in  safety-sensitive  positions  for  prohibited  drugs  and  alcohol  and  provide  an employee assistance program. The requirements for drug and alcohol testing of pipeline employees are found in 49 CFR Part 199, which incorporates the overall OPS drug testing requirements found in 49 CFR Part 40.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":316,"to":317}}}}],["28",{"pageContent":"Natural gas operators who do not comply with the safety regulations may be subject to civil penalties, compliance orders, or both. If safety problems are severe, a \"Corrective Action Order\" may be issued by OPS. This could result in the shutdown of the system.\r\nState agencies may enforce pipeline safety regulations under certification by OPS. The state agency is allowed to adopt additional or more stringent safety regulations for intrastate pipeline transportation as long as such regulations are compatible with the federal minimum regulations.

Four are particularly important. Taken in pairs they are:\r\nPRESSURE and FORCE FLOW and THROTTLING\r\nPRESSURE\r\nIn the natural gas business, the commonly used pressure units are:\r\npsi = pounds per square inch in. w.c = inches water column\r\nThese units are sometimes referred to as “pounds” and “inches.”","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":380,"to":387}}}}],["33",{"pageContent":"In the natural gas business, the commonly used pressure units are:\r\npsi = pounds per square inch in. w.c = inches water column\r\nThese units are sometimes referred to as “pounds” and “inches.”\r\nIt is important to remember that \"pounds\" and \"inches\" are the short form of expressing pressure units. There really is no such thing as a pound of pressure or an inch of pressure. They are incomplete terms. Pressure is defined as force per unit area. “Pounds” expresses only the \"force\" portion of that definition. The unit of \"area\" is missing. Thus, the complete terminology should be \"pounds per square inch.\"\r\nWhen gas is under pressure, it exerts a force against each unit of exposed area. For example, gas at a pressure of 10 psi pushes with a force of 10 pounds against each square inch of surface exposed to the gas.\r\nThere are some other forms to note as follows:\r\npsia = pounds per square inch absolute psig = pounds per square inch gauge\r\nThe relationship between the two is simple:","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":387,"to":394}}}}],["34",{"pageContent":"There are some other forms to note as follows:\r\npsia = pounds per square inch absolute psig = pounds per square inch gauge\r\nThe relationship between the two is simple:\r\npsia = psig + atmospheric pressure\r\nRevised, January, 2017                               II-1\r\nAbsolute pressure (psia) uses a perfect vacuum as the zero point. A perfect vacuum is 0 psia.\r\nGauge pressure (psig) uses the actual atmospheric pressure as the zero point. In Miami, sea level atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia. Thus, 0 psig is 14.7 psia in Miami. In Denver (5,280 feet elevation), atmospheric pressure is 12.1 psia. And 0 psig for Denver is 12.1 psia.\r\nMost references to pressure in natural gas distribution applications are gauge pressure (psig).

To properly operate, household gas appliances typically need gas at a pressure between about 5 inches w.c. and 13 inches w.c. (about 1/5 to ½ psig -- pressure limits will vary by appliance). This is known as “utilization pressure.”\r\nPressure measurement in inches is often done with an instrument called a manometer.

The highest pressure that could be measured with a \"U\" type manometer 5-feet high would be only a little over 2 psig (56 in. w.c.). However, note also that it offers a very precise way of measuring low pressures. When expressing pressure in inches, it is necessary to identify the liquid. To put it another way, there really is no such thing as an inch of pressure. Instead, it is inches of a particular liquid, in the gas business generally water or mercury. Thus, the correct expression is inches water column (in. w.c. or in. H2O).

It is measured in pounds.\r\nNote that pounds of pressure is incomplete (it should be pounds per square inch) whereas pounds of force is complete. Thus, it would be \"x\" pounds of pushing force or pulling force.\r\nFigure II-2 shows the relationship between pressure and force. Note that pressure creates a force. Also, note how much force (200 pounds) can be created with only a small amount of pressure (2 psig.) It is all a matter of diaphragm area or piston area over which the pressure is acting. A diaphragm is simply a low friction, tightly sealed, short stroke piston (just the thing for use in regulators).\r\nFigure II-2 Relationship Between Pressure and Force\r\n11.3\r\n11.3","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":424,"to":447}}}}],["38",{"pageContent":"Figure II-2 Relationship Between Pressure and Force\r\n11.3\r\n11.3\r\nRevised, January, 2017                               II-4\r\nFLOW AND THROTTLING\r\nTo throttle the flow of a fluid is to allow only a certain amount to flow and to hold back the remainder. A faucet (a valve) is a good example of a throttling device. How much water is wanted determines how far the faucet is opened. Depending on how far it is opened, it allows only a certain amount of water to flow and holds the rest back.\r\nThrottling is a basic function in a regulator (see next section for a discussion of regulators).

It allows only a certain amount of gas to flow and holds the rest back.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":447,"to":453}}}}],["39",{"pageContent":"Not all valves can be used for throttling. Some valves (like many gate valves) are designed to be either wide open or fully closed.

They are unsatisfactory for throttling gas flow, but may be suitable for uses where the valve is either fully open of fully shut.\r\nPRESSURE  REGULATION \r\nThe pressure of gas in gas piping is controlled by devices called “regulators.” Regulators are installed wherever parts of the distribution system operating at different pressures are connected. For example, Figure II-3 shows pressure regulators in the following locations:\r\n1.   On the gas main between the 450 psig piping and the 60 psig piping (Labelled “A”),\r\n2.

Because the pressure in the low pressure piping system is at ¼ psig utilization pressure, it requires no further pressure reduction before entering the customer’s house piping. Pressure regulators are required for customers connected to the 450 psig and 60 psig piping systems to prevent high pressure gas from damaging the customer’s piping and gas-burning equipment that may not be designed to withstand such pressure.\r\nRevised, January, 2017                               II-5","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":459,"to":466}}}}],["41",{"pageContent":"Revised, January, 2017                               II-5\r\nFigure II-3 Natural Gas Distribution System\r\nA regulator consists of a valve, a valve actuator and a pressure sensing element.

In addition, it must change the flow smoothly as it is opened or closed. The most widely used valve for regulators is the single-port, unbalanced, globe valve. It is economical in construction yet provides good throttling.

Referring to Figure II-4, the following is a simple explanation of how it works.\r\n1.         Spring compression works to open the valve.\r\nThe rule is: The PRIMARY VALVE OPENING FORCE in a spring regulator comes from the spring (usually, spring compression).\r\n2.

The diaphragm works to close the valve.\r\nThe rule is: The PRIMARY VALVE CLOSING FORCE in a spring regulator comes from gas pressure pushing against the diaphragm.\r\n3.

Set point (the outlet pressure a regulator is adjusted to deliver) is determined by spring compression. Turning the set point adjustment clockwise compresses the spring which increases the set point pressure, and vice versa.\r\nSOME  BASIC NAMES  AND TERMS \r\nReferring to Figure II-4, the inlet is the opening through which gas enters a regulator. The pressure of the entering gas is usually called the inlet pressure, although it could also be called the upstream or supply pressure.\r\nThe outlet is the opening by which gas leaves a regulator.

The difference between inlet and outlet pressures is sometimes called the differential across the regulator.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":490,"to":491}}}}],["48",{"pageContent":"Piping on the inlet side is upstream and piping on the outlet side is downstream. As stated previously, a regulator takes higher pressure gas from the supply and reduces it to the pressure required by the load. To do this, something is needed on the regulator to adjust it for the specific pressure required. This adjustment is called the set point adjustment and on most of today's regulators it is a screw-type device of some kind, usually a simple adjustment screw. Set point is the pressure a regulator is adjusted to deliver. It is the pressure required by the load and, in general, is the same as the outlet pressure.\r\nNote the control line referred to in Figure II-4A. It is also called a sensing line, impulse line, equalizing line or static line.

They must be carefully planned and correctly installed if the regulator is to operate satisfactorily and safely. Improperly installing a sensing or control line can cause the regulator to not respond as required.\r\nMany regulators, particularly smaller ones, do not have the external control line shown in Figure II-4A. Instead, it is internal as represented by Figure II-4B. Called internal control, it is inside some form of open throat construction or venturi tube.

If they are broken, there is no gas pressure on the diaphragm causing the regulator to open wide. This could result in the low- pressure system being subjected to the full upstream line. This can lead to a catastrophic situation where the downstream piping is over pressured causing possible failures.\r\nWhile often appearing insignificant, the vent is important to a regulator. Regulators breathe. As the internals move in the work of controlling pressure, a regulator will inhale or exhale through the vent. Therefore, the vent must be adequately protected from obstructions such as dirt, insects, ice, etc. If an obstructed vent prevents a regulator from breathing, the diaphragm will not work properly. If the vent becomes completely obstructed, then the regulator can either shut the gas off to a customer or increase the pressure to upstream pressure causing possible failures.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":497,"to":498}}}}],["51",{"pageContent":"In the event that the regulator fails open; the higher pressure gas dissipates thru the vent.\r\nAlso, water can get inside a regulator through an improperly positioned and unprotected vent.

If a regulator is installed where water may enter the vent, then most regulator vent outlets are equipped with threads. This allows piping to be attached to the vent and redirected so that water may not enter the vent. (It is important to remember that a vent screen must be reattached in this instance)\r\nThe last item is the stop valve (Figure II-5). A simple installation (such as at a house) usually has only one.

(Opening a valve too quickly has the possibility of damaging the regulator).\r\nStop valves make it possible to put a regulator into service or take it out of service. They make it possible to isolate a regulator for testing and servicing. Correct opening and closing sequences should be adequately understood (these are often specified in gas company standards and procedures).

There have been accidents due to the failure of the plastic pipe in certain types of installations. These installations are associated with older PE pipe (1960s through early","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1673,"to":1683}}}}],["249",{"pageContent":"1980s), which may be vulnerable to fractures and brittle-like cracking. The key areas of concern are where the pipe may not be properly supported in a transition area, which may cause excessive bending of the pipe.\r\nThe transition area is where the plastic pipe is connected to a fitting, valve, or riser. As the earth settles, inadequately supported plastic pipe may be subjected to high bending stresses and possible failure. Figures VI-16 through VI-19 show the use of protective sleeves  in  the  transition  areas.  Protective  sleeves,  along  with  attention  to  adequate backfill and support, can help to avoid excessive stresses. The design of a protective sleeve depends on type of soil, size of pipe, composition of the backfill, and size of the access trench or bell hole. It is imperative that pipeline operators review and follow the specific sleeving and support instructions provided by the pipe manufacturer.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1684,"to":1685}}}}],["250",{"pageContent":"Excessive bending of pipe in non-transition areas can also result in excessive stresses that can lead to plastic pipe failure. If the pipe is installed with very tight bends, the pipe wall can be stressed beyond manufacturer’s recommendations. This can result in brittle-like fracture of the pipe wall. Every manufacturer has a recommended maximum bending radius for each type and size of pipe. The maximum bending radius is increased for pipe spans that contain a fusion or mechanical joint. It is imperative that the installation of plastic pipe does not exceed the maximum bending limits for each type of pipe.\r\nBackfill material should consist of sand or native soil containing no sharp rocks or other foreign objects. Backfill material containing sharp rocks can damage the pipe and cause accidents. Proper backfill and support are essential to the installation and safe, long-term performance of plastic pipe.\r\nRevised – January, 2017                                 VI-42","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1686,"to":1688}}}}],["251",{"pageContent":"Revised – January, 2017                                 VI-42\r\nCHAPTER VII: SERVICE LINES, CUSTOMER METERS AND REGULATOR  SETS \r\nBefore locating service lines, customer meters and regulators, three points must be considered: accessibility, protection of meter sets from damage, and protection of people from release of gas at the meter set.\r\nCUSTOMER METERS AND REGULATORS: LOCATION\r\nInstall meters and service regulators in a readily accessible location.

Documentation should include the source of information used in the evaluation. For example, operators should review the results of cathodic-protection monitoring when evaluating the threat of corrosion. The written plan should identify where the cathodic-protection monitoring records are kept.\r\nRevised – January, 2017                                            IX-3","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":2411,"to":2413}}}}],["337",{"pageContent":"Revised – January, 2017                                            IX-3\r\nIn evaluating risk, an operator will usually find that the likelihood and/or consequence of a failure due to any of the 8 threats are different for different parts of the system. For example, if a system is part steel and part plastic, the plastic pipe has zero risk of corrosion. Even the steel pipe may have varying risk if some steel pipe is coated and cathodically-protected and other portions are not. In cases where the relative risk for any threat is higher on some portion of the system than the rest of the system, the operator should subdivide the system into regions with similar characteristics and for which similar actions likely would be effective in reducing risk.\r\nRISK RANKING","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":2413,"to":2415}}}}],["338",{"pageContent":"RISK RANKING\r\nAfter the likelihood and consequences of failure due to each of the 8 threats has been evaluated for every inch of the operator’s distribution system, the operator must determine which threats to which sections of the system pose the greatest relative risk to public safety.

For example, bare, unprotected steel pipe could be assigned a score of 6, while coated, cathodically-protected pipe would get a score of 2.

SME’s could be outside consultants or could be the individuals responsible for the day-to-day inspection and maintenance of the distribution system or a combination of both. The rationale for the SME’s ranking of each threat should be recorded in the written DIMP plan.\r\nAfter the relative risk of all threats to all sections of the system have been evaluated, the operator should review the list of relative risks and make sure that he/she agrees with the rankings.

The purpose of white lining the area to be located is to allow everyone involved with the dig site to know the exact location of the proposed excavation. White-lining the excavation site is an excellent way to assist the utilities or utility locators in marking lines in the work area right the first time and in less time. This technique eliminates speculation by the locator about where the excavation will take place and will often enable the utility or its agent to locate faster and more accurately.

The letter simply identifies the inspection where the concerns were identified, itemizes the concerns, and asks the operator to consider these issues in improving its safety management program.

(The letter should not be addressed or copied to the larger parent company or holding company that is not the pipeline operating company.)  Use whatever method of research necessary or contact the pipeline operating company to determine and verify who is the most senior company official. SMART is set up to assign a case to only one operator and one OPID. If there is a need to address the letter to multiple entities (e.g. the pipeline owner as well as the operator), the Region staff consults with the Region Attorney.\r\n4.5.2                    Review and Approve Letter of Concern and Send to Operator","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":35983,"to":35986}}}}],["3461",{"pageContent":"4.5.2                    Review and Approve Letter of Concern and Send to Operator\r\nInput:                 Draft Letter of Concern.

Responsibility: Region Director.\r\nDescription:      The Region Director reviews the draft Letter of Concern with Region staff and discusses any comments, changes, or corrections with Region staff. If required, Region staff revise the draft Letter of Concern. When the Letter of Concern is satisfactory, the Region staff assigns a Compliance Progress File number according to the nomenclature provided in Section 5.2. The Region Director signs the letter and sends it to the operator using the method described in Section 5.1.\r\nUpon issuance, the Region Director assigns Region staff to:\r\n•   Create a Region case file\r\n•   Enter case information into SMART, which documents the inspection results and proposed enforcement actions.\r\nP i p e l i n e S a f e t y E n f o r c e m e n t P r o c e d u r e s\r\nSection 4","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":35986,"to":35993}}}}],["3462",{"pageContent":"•   Enter case information into SMART, which documents the inspection results and proposed enforcement actions.\r\nP i p e l i n e S a f e t y E n f o r c e m e n t P r o c e d u r e s\r\nSection 4\r\nDecember 9, 2022\r\nPage 137 of 141\r\n•   Send case data to the Compliance Registry\r\nThis step is crucial to the prompt and accurate creation of an enforcement case record in the Compliance Registry.

The Compliance Progress File number and date of the notice letter are needed before this action can be completed.\r\n•   Send the Letter of Concern to the Compliance Officer and Compliance Registry.

Since all four criteria are met, the measurement of pipe-to-soil potentials is a covered task.\r\nExample 3: Meter reading.\r\n(1) Performed on a pipeline facility?
