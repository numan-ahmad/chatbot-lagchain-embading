This guidance manual for operators of small natural gas systems is part of our commitment to pipeline safety.   This manual was developed to provide an overview of pipeline compliance responsibilities under the federal pipeline safety regulations.   It is designed for the non- technically trained person who operates a master meter system, a small municipal system, or small independent system.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":35}}}}],["1",{"pageContent":"The Federal Government recognizes that many of the safety regulations are written in technical language that addresses generic requirements for both large and small natural gas systems.  This manual attempts to simplify the technical language of the regulations.\r\n\r\nFor  certain  critical  regulations,  this  manual  provides  details  of  methods  of  operation  and selection of materials that will satisfy the pipeline safety regulations.  However, this is often only one of several allowable options.  This manual provides a set of examples that operators of small natural gas systems can use to meet the minimum requirements of the pipeline safety regulations.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":37,"to":39}}}}],["2",{"pageContent":"For example, requirements for pressure testing vary throughout the pipeline safety regulations. The test pressure used in this manual is usually 100 pounds per square inch to provide clarity and consistency to small operators unfamiliar with the intricacies of natural gas pipeline operations. The operator is referred to 49 CFR Part 192 for additional details and other options for reaching and maintaining compliance.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to provide basic information to operators of small natural gas distribution and master meter systems to ensure compliance with the federal gas pipeline safety regulations.  It is hoped that this document will assist operators in achieving and maintaining a safe and efficient natural gas system.  The result will enhance public safety – the essential goal of the Office of Pipeline Safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlan K.

The requirements for drug and alcohol testing of pipeline employees are found in 49 CFR Part 199, which incorporates the overall OPS drug testing requirements found in 49 CFR Part 40.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":405,"to":407}}}}],["25",{"pageContent":"Natural gas operators who do not comply with the safety regulations may be subject to civil penalties, compliance orders, or both. If safety problems are severe, a \"Corrective Action Order\" may be issued by OPS. This could result in the shutdown of the system.\r\n\r\nState agencies may enforce pipeline safety regulations under certification by OPS. The state agency is allowed to adopt additional or more stringent safety regulations for intrastate pipeline transportation as long as such regulations are compatible with the federal minimum regulations. If a state agency is not certified, however, the DOT retains jurisdiction over intrastate pipeline systems.\r\n\r\nOperators should check with the pipeline safety agency in their state (Appendix C) to determine:\r\n      Whether a state agency has safety jurisdiction;\r\n      Whether  the  state  agency  has  pipeline  safety  requirements  that  exceed  the  federal regulations;","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":409,"to":415}}}}],["26",{"pageContent":"      Whether a state agency has safety jurisdiction;\r\n      Whether  the  state  agency  has  pipeline  safety  requirements  that  exceed  the  federal regulations;\r\n      The inspection and enforcement procedures of the state agency.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevised January, 2017                                 I-1\r\nOVERVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  natural  gas  pipeline  industry  consists  of  transmission  and  distribution  systems.

Four are particularly important. Taken in pairs they are:\r\n\r\nPRESSURE and FORCE FLOW and THROTTLING\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESSURE","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":565,"to":666}}}}],["30",{"pageContent":"PRESSURE and FORCE FLOW and THROTTLING\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESSURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the natural gas business, the commonly used pressure units are:\r\n\r\n\r\npsi = pounds per square inch in. w.c = inches water column\r\n\r\nThese units are sometimes referred to as “pounds” and “inches.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that \"pounds\" and \"inches\" are the short form of expressing pressure units. There really is no such thing as a pound of pressure or an inch of pressure. They are incomplete terms. Pressure is defined as force per unit area. “Pounds” expresses only the \"force\" portion of that definition. The unit of \"area\" is missing. Thus, the complete terminology should be \"pounds per square inch.\"\r\n\r\nWhen gas is under pressure, it exerts a force against each unit of exposed area. For example, gas at a pressure of 10 psi pushes with a force of 10 pounds against each square inch of surface exposed to the gas.\r\n\r\nThere are some other forms to note as follows:","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":666,"to":684}}}}],["31",{"pageContent":"There are some other forms to note as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\npsia = pounds per square inch absolute psig = pounds per square inch gauge\r\n\r\nThe relationship between the two is simple:\r\n\r\n\r\npsia = psig + atmospheric pressure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRevised, January, 2017                               II-1\r\nAbsolute pressure (psia) uses a perfect vacuum as the zero point.

Thus, 0 psig is 14.7 psia in Miami. In Denver (5,280 feet elevation), atmospheric pressure is 12.1 psia. And 0 psig for Denver is 12.1 psia.\r\nMost references to pressure in natural gas distribution applications are gauge pressure (psig).

This is known as “utilization pressure.”\r\n\r\nPressure measurement in inches is often done with an instrument called a manometer.

The highest pressure that could be measured with a \"U\" type manometer 5-feet high would be only a little over 2 psig (56 in. w.c.). However, note also that it offers a very precise way of measuring low pressures. When expressing pressure in inches, it is necessary to identify the liquid. To put it another way, there really is no such thing as an inch of pressure. Instead, it is inches of a particular liquid, in the gas business generally water or mercury.

Depending on how far it is opened, it allows only a certain amount of water to flow and holds the rest back.\r\n\r\nThrottling is a basic function in a regulator (see next section for a discussion of regulators).

The diaphragm works to close the valve.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rule is: The PRIMARY VALVE CLOSING FORCE in a spring regulator comes from gas pressure pushing against the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n3.   An increase in outlet pressure puts more force on the diaphragm which closes the valve.\r\nConversely, a decrease in outlet pressure opens the valve.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.   Set point (the outlet pressure a regulator is adjusted to deliver) is determined by spring compression. Turning the set point adjustment clockwise compresses the spring which increases the set point pressure, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME  BASIC NAMES  AND TERMS \r\n\r\n\r\nReferring to Figure II-4, the inlet is the opening through which gas enters a regulator.

The pressure of the exiting gas is usually called outlet pressure, although it could also be called downstream pressure.\r\n\r\nIn general, the more the inlet pressure exceeds the outlet pressure, the greater the amount of gas that can flow through the regulator and the greater the capacity of the regulator. The difference between inlet and outlet pressures is sometimes called the differential across the regulator.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1034,"to":1036}}}}],["46",{"pageContent":"Piping on the inlet side is upstream and piping on the outlet side is downstream. As stated previously, a regulator takes higher pressure gas from the supply and reduces it to the pressure required by the load. To do this, something is needed on the regulator to adjust it for the specific pressure required. This adjustment is called the set point adjustment and on most of today's regulators it is a screw-type device of some kind, usually a simple adjustment screw. Set point is the pressure a regulator is adjusted to deliver. It is the pressure required by the load and, in general, is the same as the outlet pressure.\r\n\r\nNote the control line referred to in Figure II-4A. It is also called a sensing line, impulse line, equalizing line or static line. The control line and the sensing point are vital parts of a regulator\r\n\r\n\r\nRevised, January, 2017                               II-8","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1038,"to":1043}}}}],["47",{"pageContent":"Revised, January, 2017                               II-8\r\ninstallation. They must be carefully planned and correctly installed if the regulator is to operate satisfactorily and safely. Improperly installing a sensing or control line can cause the regulator to not respond as required.\r\n\r\nMany regulators, particularly smaller ones, do not have the external control line shown in Figure II-4A. Instead, it is internal as represented by Figure II-4B. Called internal control, it is inside some form of open throat construction or venturi tube. However, whether located internally or externally, every regulator has a control line or the equivalent.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1043,"to":1046}}}}],["48",{"pageContent":"Control lines must be adequately protected against breakage. If they are broken, there is no gas pressure on the diaphragm causing the regulator to open wide. This could result in the low- pressure system being subjected to the full upstream line. This can lead to a catastrophic situation where the downstream piping is over pressured causing possible failures.\r\n\r\nWhile often appearing insignificant, the vent is important to a regulator. Regulators breathe. As the internals move in the work of controlling pressure, a regulator will inhale or exhale through the vent. Therefore, the vent must be adequately protected from obstructions such as dirt, insects, ice, etc. If an obstructed vent prevents a regulator from breathing, the diaphragm will not work properly. If the vent becomes completely obstructed, then the regulator can either shut the gas off to a customer or increase the pressure to upstream pressure causing possible failures.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1048,"to":1050}}}}],["49",{"pageContent":"In the event that the regulator fails open; the higher pressure gas dissipates thru the vent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, water can get inside a regulator through an improperly positioned and unprotected vent. Water inside a regulator can cause problems. Therefore, vents must be positioned and protected to keep the water out. This is particularly important on outdoor installations. If a regulator is installed where water may enter the vent, then most regulator vent outlets are equipped with threads. This allows piping to be attached to the vent and redirected so that water may not enter the vent. (It is important to remember that a vent screen must be reattached in this instance)\r\n\r\nThe last item is the stop valve (Figure II-5).

Allow the inlet gas to enter slowly, and the pressure to build up slowly. (Opening a valve too quickly has the possibility of damaging the regulator).\r\n\r\nStop valves make it possible to put a regulator into service or take it out of service. They make it possible to isolate a regulator for testing and servicing. Correct opening and closing sequences should be adequately understood (these are often specified in gas company standards and procedures).

A pressure regulator can malfunction by closing when it should be open, resulting in customers downstream of the regulator not getting natural gas, which is not good, but generally will not damage the downstream gas piping or customer appliances. A regulator malfunction that opens the  valve,  however,  can  damage  downstream  piping  and  customer  appliances  that  are  not designed to handle the higher pressure. For this reason, regulations require that gate stations and district regulators must have overpressure protection.\r\n\r\nThere are three basic methods of providing overpressure protection:\r\n      Pressure Relief,\r\n      Monitor Regulating,\r\n      Automatic Shutoff.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1129,"to":1154}}}}],["54",{"pageContent":"There are three basic methods of providing overpressure protection:\r\n      Pressure Relief,\r\n      Monitor Regulating,\r\n      Automatic Shutoff.\r\n\r\n\r\nPressure relief is simply dumping excess gas safely into the atmosphere.

The standby unit is normally further open than necessary, usually wide open. It takes that position because it is adjusted to a slightly higher set point than the operating regulator.

It may also be modified by passing through soil and into a sewer system containing vapors or fumes from other combustibles as well as the sewer odor itself. Gas odors inside buildings may be masked by other odors in the area, or other odors could be mistaken for the odor of natural gas, therefore, odor is not always totally reliable as an indicator of the presence or absence of gas leaks.

Find a recent gas bill with similar degree-days to the high bill. If the high bill is significantly higher than prior bills for similar periods it may indicate leakage on the system. The master meter operator should also consider whether significantly higher occupancy rates, the installation of additional gas burning equipment (converting electric water heaters to natural gas, for example) or other factors can explain the difference.

There have been accidents due to the failure of the plastic pipe in certain types of installations. These installations are associated with older PE pipe (1960s through early\r\n1980s), which may be vulnerable to fractures and brittle-like cracking. The key areas of concern are where the pipe may not be properly supported in a transition area, which may cause excessive bending of the pipe.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":5391,"to":5399}}}}],["254",{"pageContent":"The transition area is where the plastic pipe is connected to a fitting, valve, or riser. As the earth settles, inadequately supported plastic pipe may be subjected to high bending stresses and possible failure. Figures VI-16 through VI-19 show the use of protective sleeves  in  the  transition  areas.

For example, if a system is part steel and part plastic, the plastic pipe has zero risk of corrosion. Even the steel pipe may have varying risk if some steel pipe is coated and cathodically-protected and other portions are not.
